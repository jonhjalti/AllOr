# AllOr
Fortran program for assigning ALLele ORigin for crossbred livestock
Here I will put the source code for my breed origin of alleles software, AllOr. 
Version 8.1 has a bug, I fixed it for 8.2. 
The original version is described in Eir√≠ksson, J.H., Karaman, E., Su, G. and Christensen, O.F. 2021. Breed of origin of alleles and genomic predictions for crossbred dairy cows. Genetics Selection Evolotion: 53:84. Please cite that paper if AllOr is used. Otherwise it is free for anyone to use.
